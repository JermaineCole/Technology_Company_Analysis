## Stakeholder Request:

The investment team requires a thorough analysis of the top 1000 global tech companies, focusing on key metrics such as market capitalisation, country of operation, industry classification, and company performance. The objective is to identify strategic investment opportunities, particularly within high-growth areas of Software Infrastructure and Semiconductors, where companies in the US and Taiwan exhibit strong market capitalisation. Additionally, the team seeks to explore opportunities for geographical diversification by evaluating emerging markets in China and Japan, specifically within the semiconductor and electronic component sectors.
